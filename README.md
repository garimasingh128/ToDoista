## Important points
On Front End:

* Implement a feature to add Tasks.
Implement a feature to set the due date for these tasks.

On Back end:

* Implement the backend in one of the desired Tech-Stacks provided below.
Your backend is supposed to store all the tasks data received from the Frontend and store it in the Database.
You are also supposed to implement a Database in the Backend which should store all this structured data.
The data sharing between Frontend and Backend should be in JSON format rendered over REST APIs.
Zip all your Source Code, Screenshots, Deployment Instructions and Upload.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Inspiration
We were inspired to create it when we saw that not many tools are available open-source or on the Internet which do the job we intend to do. So we decided to create it as a side-project based purely to learn 



## üîÜ Tech Stack
The project is created using create-react-app and based on React.js framework.
-  JavaScript: 92.9%
-  CSS: 3.9%
-  HTML: 3.2%


 ## üíª Development guidelines

1.  Put all the code in one of the existing files in  `/src`.
    
3.  Push all the code to your own branch. Once you are sure it is working, merge it with the `dev`  branch. Let's maintain only the stable and released versions on the  `master`  branch.
    
4.  Write a kick-ass, readable, and clean code.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
